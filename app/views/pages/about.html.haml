    %p At Unity we advise you and your employee on the best ‘return to work’ strategy, based on the individual’s work activities and environment. We can also advise you on how to safely adapt the workplace, in so far as is reasonably practicable, to accommodate an individual’s safe return.

    %h1 Physician Led Occupational Health and Wellbeing Services
    %p The cost of work related ill health to your business can be significant and far reaching; in addition to sick pay, there is also the cost of temporary cover and extra supervision, as well as reduced productivity and potential legal and compensation claims.

    %p Unity can assist in keeping your employees fit, healthy and working. By identifying health hazards in your organisation and ensuring employees are fit for the job they are doing, you can reduce sickness absence and promote a positive work culture.

    %p Early management of sickness absence can also identify adjustments, restrictions and considerations to promote well-being and facilitate an earlier return to work.
